# Mary, Jane and K

At birth, there is an equal chance that either a boy or a girl will be born. Therefore, in a large population of 2-child families there will be the same number of boy-boy, boy-girl, girl-boy and girl-girl families, where x-y
means that a child of type x was born first and a child of type y was born second. 

The following helps to visualise the different types of 2-child families where B = boy and G = girl.

	BG GG

## Part A

A girl, Jane, is selected at random from the set of daughters of a large population of 2-child families. Jane has a mum, Mary, and a sibling K. K is the sibling's initial. K's gender is known to Jane and Mary, but not to us. 

Given what we know about 2-child families, Jane, Mary and K:

Q1. What is the chance that K will answer "Yes" if asked: "Are you a girl?"

  A) 1/2 B) 1/3	C) 1/4 D) 3/4

Q2. What is the chance that Jane will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have a sister?"

  A) 1/3 B) 3/4 C) 1/2 D) 1/4

Q3. What is the chance that Mary will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have 2 daughters?"

 A) 3/4 B) 1/4 C) 1/3 D) 1/2

## Part B

A mother, Miriam, is selected at random from the set of mothers of a large population of 2-child families referred to in Part A. Miriam has a daughter, Jennifer, and another child L. L is the child's initial. L's gender is known to Miriam and Jennifer, but not to us. 

If Miriam has one daughter, Jennifer is that daughter. If she has two daughters, Jennifer is the daughter selected
with a coin flip. The selection process does not permit the selection of mothers with 2 boys.

Given what we know about 2-child families, Miriam, Jennifer and L:

Q1. What is the chance that L will answer "Yes" if asked: "Are you a girl?"

  A) 1/2 B) 1/3	C) 1/4 D) 3/4

Q2. What is the chance that Jennifer will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have a sister?"

  A) 1/3 B) 3/4 C) 1/2 D) 1/4

Q3. What is the chance that Miriam will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have 2 daughters?"

  A) 3/4 B) 1/4 C) 1/3 D) 1/2

## Part C

A mother, Mc, is selected at random from the set of mothers of the large population of 2-child families referred to in Part A. Mc has a daughter, Jc, and another child Kc. Mc, Jc and Kc are all pseudonyms. Kc's gender is known to Mc and Jc, but not to us. 

If Mc has one daughter, Jc is that daughter. If she has two daughters, Jc is the daughter selected
with a coin flip. The selection process does not permit the selection of mothers with 2 boys.

Given what we know about 2-child families, Mc, Jc and Kc:

Q1. What is the chance that Kc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Are you a girl?"

  A) 1/2 B) 1/3	C) 1/4 D) 3/4

Q2. What is the chance that Jc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have a sister?"

  A) 1/3 B) 3/4 C) 1/2 D) 1/4

Q3. What is the chance that Mc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have 2 daughters?"

  A) 3/4 B) 1/4 C) 1/3 D) 1/2

## Part D

**If you multiply the answer to Part A/Q1, Part B/Q2 and Part C/Q3 and you get either 1/8 or 1/27 you may have the "wrong" answer. Contact [Jon](mailto:jon.seymour@gmail.com) to discuss before proceeding since Part D will be more interesting that way.**

You are handed a key which decodes the pseudonyms used in Part C. It turns out that Mc = Mary, Jc = Jane and Kc = K, all from Part A of this question.

Q1. What is the chance that K/Kc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Are you a girl?"
	
  A) Same as Part A/Q1. B) Same as Part C/Q1. C) Other.

Q2. What is the chance that Jane/Jc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have a sister?"

  A) Same as Part A/Q2. B) Same as Part C/Q2. C) Other.

Q3. What is the chance that Mary/Mc will answer "Yes" if asked: "Do you have 2 daughters?"

  A) Same as Part A/Q3. B) Same as Part C/Q3. C) Other.
