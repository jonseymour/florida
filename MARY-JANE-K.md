# Mary, Jane and K

At birth, there is an equal chance that either a boy or a girl will be born. Therefore, in a large population of 2-child families there will be the same number of boy-boy, boy-girl, girl-boy and girl-girl families, where x-y
means that a child of type x was born first and a child of type y was born second. 

The following helps to visualise the different type of 2-child families:
