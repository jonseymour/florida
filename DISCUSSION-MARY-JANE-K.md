## ANSWERS

The discussion below assumes that the answers to Part A, Part B and Part C are.

 Part A: Q1/A) 1/2, Q2/C) 1/2, Q3/D) 1/2

 Part B: Q1/B) 1/3, Q2/A) 1/3, Q3/C) 1/3

 Part C: Q1/B) 1/3, Q2/A) 1/3, Q3/C) 1/3

The fact that A and B yield different answers is explained by the fact that the selection process is operating on daughters of 2-child families in part A and mothers of 2 child families in Part B. So, at this point there is no paradox or contradiction there - we get different results if we view the world through different goggles.

Part C is simply a repeat of Part B used to setup Part D but uses pseudonymous labels to simplify reasoning about this case. Not surprisingly the answers for Part B and Part C are the same.

## DISCUSSION

Where it becomes interesting is Part D where we assert a correspondence between
the labels used in Part C and the terms of Part A.

According to Part A, K has a 1/2 chance of being a girl, according to Part C/D, K has a 1/3 chance of being a girl - apparently a contradiction.

### Wnat does this apparent contradiction mean?

One way to deal with the contradiction is to deny it is really a contradiction as we did when we explained away the difference between Part A and Part B above - we were sampling different abstract processes, so the fact that we get
different abstract answers is not surprising.

However, Part D is still troubling, since we have sampled two different abstract processes that have yielded two different probabilistic models of the same concrete family. One asks us to believe the family will behave one way with probability 1/2, the other asks us to beieve they will behave that same way with probability of only 1/3. What now, are we meant believe about how the family will behave?

It should be noted that if Part C is accurate about the "selection at random" that produces Mc, Jc and Kc, it would only produce a Mc, Jc and Kc that matches Mary, Jane and K very infrequently - with a probability proportional to the inverse of the population size. One interpretation of this observation is that the perverse implication of Part D occurs so infrequently we can ignore it. Maybe.
